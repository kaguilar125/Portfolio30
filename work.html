      <div class="grid-item"><p style="font-family:'Telex'"><br>To build Wordle in Index, I designed a user-friendly interface with an input system for guesses and implemented a feedback mechanism using color-coded tiles. The game logic involved generating a random five-letter word, comparing user guesses, and providing immediate feedback on correct letters and positions. I also incorporated a limited number of attempts, fostering strategic thinking and deduction. The simplicity of design and engaging gameplay contributed to the successful creation of the Wordle game within the Index platform.</br></p></div>

      <div class="grid-item"><p style="font-family:'Telex'"><br>Creating a Super Mario game in Index involved developing a dynamic platformer with responsive controls and vibrant graphics. I focused on designing iconic levels, incorporating obstacles, power-ups, and enemy characters to emulate the classic Mario experience. Implementing player movement, jumping mechanics, and collision detection were crucial aspects of the game's functionality. Additionally, I integrated scoring systems and level progression, ensuring an engaging and challenging gameplay experience. The final result was a nostalgic yet innovative Super Mario game within the Index framework.

      <div class="grid-item"><p style="font-family:'Telex'"><br>Constructing a Drake-themed experience in Index required attention to both visual and auditory elements. I integrated graphics and animations reflecting Drake's distinct style, capturing his persona within the platform. Incorporating his music as a soundtrack added an immersive layer to the experience. The project involved creating an interface that allowed users to navigate through Drake's discography, providing a seamless blend of interactive visuals and audio. The outcome was an engaging and interactive homage to Drake's artistry, bringing his music and persona to life within the Index platform.</br></p></div>
